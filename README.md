Predicting personality type based on users tweets on twitter using machine learning. The goal is to determing and classify personality type given the tweets from users. This is an aspect of Matural Language Processing (NLP) that deals with text classification. The project consists of the following:
1. Text preprocessing
2.  1. convert to lowercase
3.  2. Removal of stopwords
4.  3. Stemming
5.  4. Lemmatization
2. Model Building 
3.  1. XGBoost
4.  2. Random Forest
5.  3. Decision Tree
6.  4. AdaBoost Classifier
7.  5. Gradient Boosting
8.  6. Multinomial Naive bayes
3. Model Evaluation
